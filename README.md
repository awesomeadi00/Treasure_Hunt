# Treasure_Hunt
This is a physical computing game I made using p5js and Arduino IDE. 

This game is very simple: 
- There is a radar scanner which moves back and forth to try and detect the user. 

- There will be a random pile of trash all over the table and hidden among that trash is some piece of treasure. It's the user's job to find that piece of treasure without the radar detecting them!

- There are options to set a difficulty. The harder it is, the faster the radar sensor will move, making it even harder for the user to hide from its range.

- If the radar sensor does detect them, they have a second to react and get out of range before they lose.
